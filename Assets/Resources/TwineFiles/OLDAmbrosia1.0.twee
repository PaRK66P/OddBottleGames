If I could acquire that power or get that Ghoul on my side... [[0.2]]


:: 0.2 {"position":"225,3775","size":"100,100"}
This would be a whole lot easier. [[1]]


:: 1 {"position":"325,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Such boldness...sauntering in here so full of vigor, so full of *life*. [[1.1]]


:: 1.1 {"position":"425,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: A worthy adversary, all the better that your blood tastes so sweet. [[C1]]


:: 1.2.1 {"position":"525,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Honed for survival. You do what you must down here. [[1.2.1.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1 {"position":"425,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Your own skills are to be praised. And I do not do so often. [[C1.2.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1.1 {"position":"225,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: If you wish to hear more from me... [[1.2.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"125,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I shall have to see more of you fighting...perhaps as allies. [[C1.2.1.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"125,3175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I've had enough, simply put. There will be nothing left here... [[1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"125,3075","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You are the first human I have spoken to in a long time. [[1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"125,2975","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I will not stoop to convince you. But I shall die honourably regardless. [[C1.2.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.1.1.2 {"position":"325,3275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: It is simply not my...style. But enough. Idle chatter does not suit this end. [[C1.2.1.2]]


:: 1.2.2 {"position":"625,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: No one's been there in a thousand years. Or has it been longer... [[1.2.2.1]]


:: 1.2.2.1 {"position":"625,3275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Who knows what you're going to find in there, [[1.2.2.1.1]]


:: 1.2.2.1.1 {"position":"625,3175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I heard the last only survived a century. But, why do you wish to reach it? [[C1.2.2]]


:: 1.2.2.1.1.1 {"position":"525,2975","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Hm. How about we strike a deal? [[1.2.2.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"525,2875","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You've proven your capabilities, so I'll help you. Take me with you to the core, [[1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.2.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"525,2775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: And once we've defeated it, I want to see the surface. [[C1.2.2.2]]


:: 1.2.2.1.1.2 {"position":"725,2975","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: There's no acquiescing here. You can try to finish me. [[1.2.2.1.1.2.1]]


:: 1.2.2.1.1.2.1 {"position":"725,2875","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Or, if you wish to kill it, my services would be...available. [[C1.2.2.2.2]]


:: 1.2.3 {"position":"625,3475","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You don't owe me anything. But it has been so long since I've seen a Hunter. [[1.2.3.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1 {"position":"725,3475","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Humour me, is it just to kill? Or do you wish for more... [[C1.2.3]]


:: 1.2.3.1.1 {"position":"825,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: More...Power. The core is the strongest source of that. [[1.2.3.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1.1.1 {"position":"825,3275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Complete control. Total domination. But only over the Dungeon. [[1.2.3.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1.1.1.1 {"position":"825,3175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: And with the Dungeon in this state...I don't quite believe that power will last. [[1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"925,3175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I would quite like to see the outcome regardless. Hunter, take me with you. [[C1.2.3.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1.2 {"position":"925,3475","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia:  Of course, which is why I intend to help. [[1.2.3.1.2.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1.2.1 {"position":"1025,3475","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You're the first living being I've seen in over six decades, [[1.2.3.1.2.1.1]]


:: 1.2.3.1.2.1.1 {"position":"1125,3475","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Or has it been more...Either way, I'm sick of waiting. Take me with you. [[C1.2.3.2]]


:: 2 {"position":"525,3675","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Hm...as intended. Tell me, Hunter, why have you come this far? [[2.1]]


:: 2.1 {"position":"525,3575","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Your eyes don't look like that of one who wishes to die. [[C1.2]]


:: 3 {"position":"625,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: So serious, although your way of fighting already showed as much. [[3.1]]


:: 3.1 {"position":"725,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Surely there's no harm in humouring me for a moment, [[C3]]


:: 3.1.1 {"position":"925,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: So *gracious*. You've proven your strength, surely you feel I've proven mine. [[3.1.1.1]]


:: 3.1.1.1 {"position":"1025,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: So let me proposition you, I'll help you get to the core... [[3.1.1.1.1]]


:: 3.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1125,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: If you take me out of here with you. [[C3.1]]


:: 3.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1325,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia:  You have eyes, no? Look around. This place doesn't have much longer left. [[3.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 3.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1425,3775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: My chances up there are better than the definitive death that awaits me here. [[C3.1.1]]


:: 3.1.1.1.1.2 {"position":"1225,3875","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Of course not, I thought you'd use that pretty little head of yours, [[3.1.1.1.1.2.1]]


:: 3.1.1.1.1.2.1 {"position":"1225,3975","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I'm dead regardless, so what's the loss for you? [[C3.2]]


:: 3.1.2 {"position":"825,3875","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Then why exactly are you asking me to surrender? [[3.1.2.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1 {"position":"825,3975","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: It seems you are slightly intrigued, after all, you haven't killed me yet. [[3.1.2.1.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1 {"position":"825,4075","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Perhaps I am to mention my desire to go further. [[C3.3]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.1 {"position":"725,4175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Good. *sigh* This place is dying, I have no intention of waiting to die with it. [[3.1.2.1.1.1.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"625,4175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I'll help you get to the core, defeat it if you so wish. [[3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"525,4175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: *If*, you'll bring me up to the surface. [[C3.3.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.2 {"position":"925,4175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Hold on! [[3.1.2.1.1.2.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.2.1 {"position":"925,4275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: This brings me no pleasure to offer my services in such a position. [[3.1.2.1.1.2.1.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.2.1.1 {"position":"1025,4275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: But I can help you get to the core. [[3.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1]]


:: 3.1.2.1.1.2.1.1.1 {"position":"1125,4275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Just bring me to the surface when you're done. [[C3.3.2]]


:: 4 {"position":"100,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Hearty, aren't we. As much as I'd love to enable your theatrics, [[4.1]]


:: 4.1 {"position":"200,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I have a feeling you have the intention of following through, [[C4]]


:: 4.1.1 {"position":"400,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Only when someone interesting catches my eye. [[4.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1 {"position":"500,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Your strength is to be admired, [[4.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1 {"position":"600,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: It's been too long since I've met someone of your prowess, [[4.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"700,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You're sure to give this place a good run. [[C4.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"900,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia:  I've long accepted my death, I'd rather it be by the hands of a valiant fighter, [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1000,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Than the alternative of simply wasting away here. [[C4.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1200,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: This dungeon won't be alive for much longer. I know you're strong, [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1300,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You must have fought plenty of Ghouls before, [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1400,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: So you must feel that we, down here...we're not exactly a challenge. [[C4.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1600,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: ...It's...not that simple...Perhaps, ah to hell with it! [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1700,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I want to live. Take me with you. [[C4.1.1.1.1.]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.2 {"position":"800,4700","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: That wasn't the intention, but if it were to work... [[4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1 {"position":"800,4800","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I may be so bold to comment on your capabilities, [[4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1 {"position":"800,4900","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Perhaps the very real possibility of you making it out of here alive. [[C4.1.2]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1 {"position":"900,5000","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: You're impatient, clearly. I'll get to it. I don't wish to die here. [[4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1]]


:: 4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1000,5000","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: With my help, you're sure to stand a chance. So I want in. [[C4.1.2.1]]


:: Ally1 {"position":"0,3275","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Good. I shall be watching you closely.


:: Ally10 {"position":"325,4175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: There's more extra parts than just hands. I'll show you what I can do.


:: Ally11 {"position":"1225,4375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Ha...let us go forth.


:: Ally14 {"position":"1900,4600","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Excellent. We march on.


:: Ally15 {"position":"1100,5100","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Keep your eyes on me all you like.


:: Ally2 {"position":"25,2775","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Charming...let us get out of this state then.


:: Ally3 {"position":"425,3175","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: I shall not be a fool to turn down an offer made in arms. Lead on.


:: Ally4 {"position":"525,2575","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: A wise choice. Let us go forth.


:: Ally5 {"position":"825,2675","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Then we must waste no time. You will answer my question later.


:: Ally6 {"position":"925,3075","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: And help you shall have, let us go on.


:: Ally7 {"position":"1225,3375","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: By all means, lead the way.


:: Ally8 {"position":"1525,3675","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: Especially considering I know the heart. Let us press on.


:: Ally9 {"position":"1425,3975","size":"100,100"}
Ambrosia: That goes without saying...I'll be right behind you.


:: C1 {"position":"525,3775","size":"100,100"}
I'll take that as a compliment.  [[2]] 

Enjoy it while it lasts, now surrender. [[3]]

It'll be the last you taste, you *Ghoul*[[4]]


:: C1.2 {"position":"525,3475","size":"100,100"}
My eyes are just on you, your fighting skills are...impressive. [[1.2.1]]

I'm reaching the core, no matter what it takes. [[1.2.2]]

I don't owe you an explanation. [[1.2.3]]


:: C1.2.1 {"position":"325,3375","size":"100,100"}
Perhaps I can convince you to do more of that? [[1.2.1.1.1]]

Why not? [[1.2.1.1.2]]


:: C1.2.1.1 {"position":"125,3275","size":"100,100"}
Perhaps, I would like that. [[Ally1]]

Why would you wish to be allies? [[1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: C1.2.1.1.1 {"position":"125,2875","size":"100,100"}
If you're going to die, at least do so by my side then. [[Ally2]]

Ghouls are not to be trusted, so you shall die here. [[Kill1]]


:: C1.2.1.2 {"position":"325,3175","size":"100,100"}
End? No I quite like this idle chatter. Join me. [[Ally3]]

Indeed. Your end shall be swift. [[Kill2]]


:: C1.2.2 {"position":"625,3075","size":"100,100"}
To kill it...to take it. I'll know when I'm there. [[1.2.2.1.1.1]]

That's none of your concern, step aside or I'll deal with you here. [[1.2.2.1.1.2]]


:: C1.2.2.2 {"position":"525,2675","size":"100,100"}
Your strength will be a valuable asset. I accept. [[Ally4]]

I'm not into your kind. [[Kill3]]


:: C1.2.2.2.2 {"position":"725,2775","size":"100,100"}
...Perhaps I do wish to kill it. [[Ally5]]

I don't need your help. [[Kill4]]


:: C1.2.3 {"position":"825,3475","size":"100,100"}
...More? [[1.2.3.1.1]]

Killing is the only thing on the table. [[1.2.3.1.2]]


:: C1.2.3.1 {"position":"1025,3175","size":"100,100"}
...So be it. I could use the extra...help. [[Ally6]]

And chance you taking it? No. [[Kill5]]


:: C1.2.3.2 {"position":"1225,3475","size":"100,100"}
Don't get in my way. [[Ally7]]

A bold demand, I decline. [[Kill6]]


:: C3 {"position":"825,3775","size":"100,100"}
You have one minute.[[3.1.1]]

I don't have time to humour you. [[3.1.2]]


:: C3.1 {"position":"1225,3775","size":"100,100"}
Why would you want to leave? [[3.1.1.1.1.1]]

You think I'm going to trust you? [[3.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: C3.1.1 {"position":"1525,3775","size":"100,100"}
I suppose it'd be an easier fight with you on my side.[[Ally8]]

I'll be damned if I help you terrorise the surface. [[Kill7]]


:: C3.2 {"position":"1325,3975","size":"100,100"}
...You're dead the second you make a wrong move[[Ally9]]

I won't be taken for a fool. [[Kill8]]


:: C3.3 {"position":"825,4175","size":"100,100"}
Fine, state your piece. Quickly. [[3.1.2.1.1.1]]

If you're that eager for me to finish the job [[3.1.2.1.1.2]]


:: C3.3.1 {"position":"425,4175","size":"100,100"}
An extra hand can't hurt. [[Ally10]]

As if I'd believe that. [[Kill9]]


:: C3.3.2 {"position":"1225,4275","size":"100,100"}
If you'd just said that to begin with. [[Ally11]]

No chance. [[Kill10]]


:: C4 {"position":"300,4600","size":"100,100"}
Perceptive are we. [[4.1.1]]

Your feeling would be correct. [[Kill11]]


:: C4.1 {"position":"800,4600","size":"100,100"}
You don't sound like someone who's about to die. [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Flattery won't save you here. [[4.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: C4.1.1 {"position":"1100,4600","size":"100,100"}
Wasting away? [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Then I'll grant that. [[Kill12]]


:: C4.1.1.1 {"position":"1500,4600","size":"100,100"}
Then why not leave? [[4.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Insult my strength, I'll show you. [[Kill13]]


:: C4.1.1.1.1. {"position":"1800,4600","size":"100,100"}
I like your spirit. Why not, come with me. [[Ally14]]

No. [[Kill14]]


:: C4.1.2 {"position":"800,5000","size":"100,100"}
What are you trying to say? [[4.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1]]

I'm done playing around. [[Kill15]]


:: C4.1.2.1 {"position":"1100,5000","size":"100,100"}
...I'll be watching you. [[Ally15]]

Your wishes mean nothing to me. [[Kill16]]
