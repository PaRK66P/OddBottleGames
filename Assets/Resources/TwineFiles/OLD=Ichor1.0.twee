Ichor: Hunter...it is...commendable, that you made it, this far. [[Next->C1]]


:: C1 {"position":"200,2200","size":"100,100"}
Everyone's full of flattery today. [[1->R1]]

It is commendable you lasted so long. [[2->R2]]

Your power is mine. [[3->R3]]


:: CR1 {"position":"300,1800","size":"100,100"}
I wouldn't be aversed to helping you remember. [[1->R1.1.1.1]]

I though you'd want a little bit of small talk before your death. [[2->R1.1.1.2]]


:: CR1.1 {"position":"100,1600","size":"100,100"}
The Hunter: Freedom. [[1->R1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Reprieve. [[2->R1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR1.1.1 {"position":"50,1200","size":"100,100"}
You do not control the surface. [[1->R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Destroying the Dungeons solves that. [[2->R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR1.1.1.1 {"position":"50,800","size":"100,100"}
...I do not wish to fight anymore. [[1->R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

The cores power...it's more extensive that I realised. [[2->R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"50,600","size":"100,100"}
Freedom is what you make of it. Up there we can be free from these places.  [[Next->R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Freedom can mean many things, death will be your freedom. [[End It->Kill2]]


:: CR1.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"50,300","size":"100,100"}
Have you ever even tried? [[Give it hope->Leave Together1]]

Then I shall put you out of your misery. [[End it->Kill1]]


:: CR1.1.1.1.2 {"position":"350,800","size":"100,100"}
Power is not what I seek, it can't control me. [[R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1]]

You will submit to me. [[End it->Kill4]]


:: CR1.1.1.1.2.1 {"position":"350,600","size":"100,100"}
I will leave, but with you. [[Give it hope->Leave Together2]]

I will destroy this place. [[End it->Kill3]]


:: CR1.1.1.2 {"position":"350,1200","size":"100,100"}
Removing a heart should destroy the Dungeon, I just have to get you out. [[Next->R1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1]]

So kill you I shall. [[End it->Kill6]]


:: CR1.1.1.2.1 {"position":"350,1000","size":"100,100"}
Have you even tried? [[Give it Hope->Leave Together3]]

Then...my only option is to destroy you. [[End it->Kill5]]


:: CR1.1.2 {"position":"650,1400","size":"100,100"}
My resolve is strong, I can get you out. [[Next->R1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

It will not ensnare me, I will conquer it. [[End it->Kill8]]


:: CR1.1.2.1 {"position":"650,1000","size":"100,100"}
I did not come here to be the first to do so, but I will. [[Give it hope->Leave Together4]]

You do not know me, I am stronger than you think. [[End it->Kill7]]


:: CR1.2 {"position":"675,1700","size":"100,100"}
Surely if you leave, the voices will stop? [[Next->R1.1.1.2.1.1.1]]

I can grant that request. [[End it->Kill10]]


:: CR1.2.1 {"position":"875,1600","size":"100,100"}
You have paid your dues. It's time to move on. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together9]]

:: CR2 {"position":"600,2200","size":"100,100"}
What do you mean? [[1->R2.1.1]]

Well...this isn't what I expected. [[2->R2.1.2]]


:: CR2.1 {"position":"700,1900","size":"100,100"}
You suffer this pain? [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

You're trying to talk me out of it...I won't be denied this. [[End it->Kill13]]


:: CR2.1.1 {"position":"1100,1900","size":"100,100"}
I came here with the intention of reaching the heart of the Dungeon. [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

I came here to fight, to see if the heart is anything worth taking. [[2->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.1.1.1 {"position":"1600,1900","size":"100,100"}
What about you? [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1]]

It's not over until this place is destroyed. [[2->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1800,1600","size":"100,100"}
Why not try to leave before then? [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

I can put an end to it now. [[2->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.1.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1800,1300","size":"100,100"}
It's not like you'll be alone. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together17]]

If you can't leave...I'll put an end to your miserable fate. [[End it->Kill15]]


:: CR2.1.1.1.1.2 {"position":"2100,1600","size":"100,100"}
No, I must help you, I can get you out. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together18]]

A mercy killing is the honourable thing to do... [[End it->Kill16]]


:: CR2.1.1.1.2 {"position":"1900,1900","size":"100,100"}
My fate was sealed the moment I decided to destroy this place, I will see it through. [[End it->Kill17]]

Surely there's more than one way to go about this [[Next->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.2.1.1]]


:: CR2.1.1.1.2.1 {"position":"2200,1900","size":"100,100"}
...I don't need to take your place. I can just take you. Out. Outside [[Give it Hope->Leave Together19]]

It appears there is only one option then. I will kill you. [[End it->Kill20]]


:: CR2.1.1.2 {"position":"1100,1500","size":"100,100"}
I can't just...leave? [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

If I leave, you're coming with me. [[2->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.1 {"position":"1100,1100","size":"100,100"}
You don't sound like your mind is gone. [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

If I've lasted this long...I can last long enough to get you out too. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together12]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.1.1 {"position":"1100,800","size":"100,100"}
Surely getting you out of here would...help? [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

What you once were? [[2->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.1.1.1 {"position":"1100,400","size":"100,100"}
You're not in any position to resist my help. [[Get it Out->Leave Together10]]

Then a mercy killing is all I can offer. [[End it->Kill11]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"1600,800","size":"100,100"}
You were a human once, surely that part of you is still there. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together11]]

Leaving you like this...I must put an end to it. [[End it->Kill12]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.2 {"position":"1400,1400","size":"100,100"}
I hadn't even thought of that. [[1->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1]]

I hadn't even thought of that... [[2->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.2.1 {"position":"1400,1100","size":"100,100"}
A friend. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together13]]

I haven't thought further than freeing you from here. [[Next->R2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.2.1.1 {"position":"1600,1100","size":"100,100"}
Maybe lacking those traits is what got you here...let me teach you. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together14]]

If you won't come with me, there's only one thing I can do. [[End it->Kill14]]


:: CR2.1.1.2.2.2 {"position":"1600,1400","size":"100,100"}
I jest, once I get you out you're free to do as you wish. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together15]]

I'm sure you've wondered what it feels like to be the one getting conquered for once. [[Give it...hope?->Leave Together16]]


:: CR2.2 {"position":"1200,2200","size":"100,100"}
...I do. [[1->R2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1]]

Then you are finished. [[End it->Kill25]]


:: CR2.2.1 {"position":"1600,2200","size":"100,100"}
I'm different. [[1->R2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

I don't want to kill you. [[2->R2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR2.2.1.1 {"position":"1900,2100","size":"100,100"}
How will it all end? [[R2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

I AM different. [[End it->Kill21]]


:: CR2.2.1.2 {"position":"1800,2300","size":"100,100"}
Why can't you leave? [[R2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.2.12.2.1.2.1]]

If this will put you at peace... [[End it->Kill22]]


:: CR2.2.1.2.1 {"position":"2000,2300","size":"100,100"}
You don't have to do it alone. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together21]]

If it's not possible then...I'll grant you a swift end. [[End it->Kill23]]


:: CR2.2.2.1.1.1 {"position":"2300,2100","size":"100,100"}
Why have you accepted this? [[R2.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

I'll move it along then. [[End it->Kill18]]


:: CR2.2.2.1.1.1.1 {"position":"2600,2100","size":"100,100"}
Well that won't do. I'll give you a reason to live. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together20]]

I still can't just leave...I can end it now. [[End it->Kill19]]


:: CR3 {"position":"600,2600","size":"100,100"}
What do you mean, voices? [[1->R3.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

And be reborn, more powerful than ever before. [[2->R3.1.1.1.1.1.2]]


:: CR3.1 {"position":"1100,2500","size":"100,100"}
You...live like this? [[1->R3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

That is exactly what I want. [[End it->Kill26]]


:: CR3.1.1 {"position":"1700,2500","size":"100,100"}
It isn't...right, leaving you here. [[1->R3.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

You will not fool me, that power will be mine. [[End it->Kill27]]


:: CR3.2 {"position":"1000,2700","size":"100,100"}
I will be different. [[1->R3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1]]

A life outside of this place is not worth living. [[End it->Kill28]]


:: CR3.2.1 {"position":"1500,2700","size":"100,100"}
Pity? There is nothing to pity about me, nor my choice. [[Next->R3.1.1.1.1.1.2.1.1.1.1.1.1.1]]

Do not look down on me. I am your end. [[End it->Kill29]]


:: CR3.2.1.1 {"position":"1900,2700","size":"100,100"}
My fate is my own to conquer. [[End it->Kill31]]

As will yours. [[End it->Kill30]]


:: CR31.1.1 {"position":"2000,2500","size":"100,100"}
I can make up for my wrongdoings. I can try. [[Give it Hope->Leave Together22]]
